## üìñ Overview

*Java-Programming-2024* is a collection of Java programs created as practice exercises to learn the fundamentals and core concepts of Java programming.  
The repository covers a wide range of topics, starting from variables and data types, conditionals, loops, and arrays, up to basic GUI applications and error handling.  
The main goal is to provide a strong foundation in Java so learners can confidently build small to medium-scale applications.
